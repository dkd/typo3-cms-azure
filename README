TYPO3 CMS Azure Package Creator
  Package Creation:
    Just cd to this directory and run azure.sh
    The script will patch the TYPO3 CMS source with the local patches from ./patches, add some web application config files and then zip it into a bundle

Actual changes to the TYPO3 source:
  OpenSSL/rsaauth:
    A minimal OpenSSL config was added
    These config is set in the env variable OPENSSL_CONF and passed to calls in the rsaauth PhpBackend


Reformat patches:
  git format-patch -k "HEAD~`ls -1 ../patches | wc -l|xargs`"
