TYPO3 CMS Azure Package Creator
  Setup:
    This git repository needs to be checked out into a folder called typo3 to enable the zipping process!

  Package Creation:
    Then just cd to this directory and run azure.sh
    The script will package the (slightly modified) TYPO3 CMS source and overlay it with azure specific configuration files in ./overlay 

  Update:
    

Changes to the TYPO3 source:
  Install Process:
    The first install check does not look for the existance of typo3conf because we are shipping these, instead it looks for a file at getFirstInstallFilePath()
    We are using this functionality instead of ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL because we cannot be sure, that ENABLE_INSTALL_TOOL has matching date to allow the install

  Fileinfo:
    The hard dependency on the php fileinfo extension has been removed because it is not present by default on Azure systems
    Instead it is a weak dependency, with mime_content_type as fallback
  
  OpenSSL/rsaauth:
    A minimal OpenSSL config was added
    These config is set in the env variable OPENSSL_CONF and passed to calls in the rsaauth PhpBackend
    The config passing sometimes has problems with TYPO3 changes, so functionality should be checked on each rebase

  Extension Manager:
    The extension cache is taking 17MB of the 20MB available on free Azure Websites
    At "import" step now only the last meta data version of each package is saved to the cache
    This will result in unmatched md5s at Package (Introduction) installation, thus the md5 check is skipped (momentarily for all)

Todo:
  Fix package handling/reenable md5 checks

Future:
  Remote dependency resolving? Probably happening in v7
  Porting fileinfo change to Core: https://review.typo3.org/#/c/31256/
  Improve OpenSSL config in core or use PHP only lib as fallback
